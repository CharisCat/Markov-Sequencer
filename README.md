# After-Eight-Step
(working prototype) The After Eight Step is an Arduino and Max powered 8 step sequencer with modern machine learning functionality. 
Using Markov Chains it is able to generate musical accompaniment based on any sequence of notes!

The Max Patch is pretty hard to use. Sorry. I will be doing a proper GUI at some point in the future.

I will also write up more here eventually but I only just clicked the create a readme button!
